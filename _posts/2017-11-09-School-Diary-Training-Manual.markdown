Step 2:  create a late fee template for each fee type. For example if you have Tuition, Transport &amp; Daycare, you need to create a late fee configuration for each item separately.

Step 3: select appropriate late fee period, charge type and amount to configure the late fee.

System will automatically add late fee for each fee type once it is configured. Late fee charges will be shown to admin when the payment is made. Admin can override and chose a different late fee or nullify it on its own discretion.
