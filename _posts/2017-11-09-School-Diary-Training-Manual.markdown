Step 3: if the total paid amount is less than the due amount, a new entry for the remainder (due amount â€“ paid amount) will be created with appropriate comment. For ex if due amount was 27,000 and only 22,000 is paid then a new entry of 5,000 will be created with the same due date as original entry.  Please refer to the screenshots below

Step 3: select appropriate late fee period, charge type and amount to configure the late fee.

System will automatically add late fee for each fee type once it is configured. Late fee charges will be shown to admin when the payment is made. Admin can override and chose a different late fee or nullify it on its own discretion.
